                Hello! My name is Raymond Park and currently a 
                senior majoring Chemical Engineering and 
                Mathematics at University
                of Texas at Austin. 
                I have great passion for classical music, cooking,
                powerelifting, and teaching.

                My current research focus is: Single molecule experiments. 
                Currently, I'm working with Dr. Dmitrii Makarov on tecniques
                to determine the degree of Non-Markovianity of a Single
                molecule trajectory. The main question we want to ask ourselves
                is: "Given a particle's trajectory, can we determine if it 
                moves purely through Browian motion (randomly) or with some
                memory?" Currently, we are finishing up using compression algorthim 
                as our method. 
            </p>

                In my free time, I like practice piano and cello, along 
                with powerlifting. I also do enjoy coding Project Euler's problems. 
                I really enjoyed solving math olympiad problems, but having ran into 
                a lot of computer science students in college, I fell in love with
                coding, especially algorthims. I'm currently pursuing a Computer 
                science certicate as well.

                Feel free to check out my Youtube videos of my playing of cello and piano!
                My repertoire list can be found under Gallery section!
