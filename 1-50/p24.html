        <h2>Problem 24: Lexicographic permutations</h2>
        <div class="white">
            <p>
                A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. 
                For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the 
                digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are 
                listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. 
                The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

            </p>
            <p>
                <center>
                012,   021 ,  102 ,  120  , 201  , 210
               </center>

            </p>
            <p>
                What is the millionth lexicographic permutation 
                of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Algorthim:</h3>
        <p class="algo">
            This is more of a math problem thatn anything. The key part of this problem is to use
            factorials. Notice in the example given that the first 6 lexicographic numbers
            are permutations of 0,1,2. So, we can utilize how many premutatiosn are required to filled
            1,000,000 positions.
        </p>
        <p class="algo">
            There are 10! Lexiographic permutations using 0-9 digits, equivalent to 3,628,800, which
            exceeds 1,000,000. Hence, we start at 9! We see that it takes, we went through all the digits
            that start with 0 or 1 since 9! = 362880. So 2*9! is 725760. Now, we have 274240 numbers
            left to go through. But we know that the starting digit is 2.
        </p>
        <p class="algo">
            Now, since we have used one digit, there are 9 digits left. But we must check how many 
            numbers starting with a particular number we went through. This is a similar process as above:
            8! = 40320, 6*8! = 241920, now we have 32,320 digits to go through. We can keep doing this process
            and we are left with the 1,000,000th lexicographic number. Code is still provided!
