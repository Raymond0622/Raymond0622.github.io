                You are given the following information, 
                but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
1 Jan 1900 was a Monday. <br>
Thirty days has September, <br>
April, June and November. <br>
All the rest have thirty-one, <br>
Saving February alone, <br>
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine. <br>
And on leap years, twenty-nine. <br>
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
            </p>
            <p>
                How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?

        <h3>Algorthim:</h3>
        <p class="algo">
            The key part of this solution is to use modular arthimetic.
            There will be two different set of "pushes" depending on if the year
            is a leap year or not. Every month, certain number of days are "pushed" from 
            the prior month.
        <p class="algo">
            For example, if we start January 1st as a Monday, and January has 31 days, then 
            we are pushing Monday on Feburary by 3 days since 31 is congruent to 3 (mod 7). Hence, it will be
            Thursday on Feb 1st. So, we assign numbers to each days:
            $$ Monday = 1 $$ $$ Tuesday = 2 $$ and so on. Sunday will be 0. Jan 1st of 1901 is a Wednesday, hence,
            the initial value is 2. Then we add the number of pushes correspinding to each month, and check
            if its 0 (mod 7) every month and keep track of how many 0 (mod 7) after each push.
        </p>
        <p class = "algo">
            Also have to keep track of Leap days which is indicated with using two different push
            arrays.
        </p>
        <p class="algo">
            For example, lets do a sample calculation. The table below shows the number
            of days and "pushes" for a given month. Let's say Jan 1st is a Tuesday, then we
            indicate the initial day as 2. Then after January, Feb 1st will be 2 + 3 (mod 7), which is 
            5. This corresponds to Saturday. We keep doing this until we have iterated from year 1901 to 2000 
            Dec.
