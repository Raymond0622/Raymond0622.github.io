        <h2>Problem 43: Sub-string divisibility
        </h2>
        <div class="white">
            <p>
                The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a 
                rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.
            </p>
            <p>      
                Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>
                    d2d3d4=406 is divisible by 2
                    d3d4d5=063 is divisible by 3
                    d4d5d6=635 is divisible by 5
                    d5d6d7=357 is divisible by 7
                    d6d7d8=572 is divisible by 11
                    d7d8d9=728 is divisible by 13
                    d8d9d10=289 is divisible by 17
                </pre>

            </p>
            <p>
                Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.

        <h3>Algorthim:</h3>
        <p class="algo">
            This problem actually gave me a lot of headache. I attempted to solve this first try and
            my code was absolutely ugly with bunch of nested for loops
        </p>
        <p class="algo">
            But after couple months of coding, there are a lot of new functions/classes I can use, specifcally
            something called permutatation
        </p>
        <p class="algo">
            So, we first create an array with our possible digits (0 through 9). Then we find all the permutation 
            of such digits. Then, we iteratively form 3 digit values from the far right and use our store[] array
            which contains our divisor to check for our necessary condition.
        </p>
        <p class="algo">
            We go through the store[] divisors. If we don't get our condition, we break. If we do we raise our \(k\)
            value by 1. If at the end of the loop our k = 7, then it's a sub-string divible number!

        </p>
