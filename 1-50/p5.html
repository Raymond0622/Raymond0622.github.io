                2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

            The question is asking: "What is the maximum power of each prime from 2-19?"
            First, we have to decide how to produce these primes if lets say we wanted to find
            the smallest number from 1-100? One can use Sieve of Erathosene or Atkins.       
         </p>
        <p class ="algo">
            My method list_Primes() takes in a number and goes through every integer up to that number
            and stores a number if that no number in a stored list of "primes" is divisible.
            This is similar to sieve method. However, this method is pretty inefficient.

            list: list of primes from 1-20
            power: powers of each prime (same order as the list) that divides value
