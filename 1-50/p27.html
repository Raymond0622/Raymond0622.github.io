        <h2>Problem 27: Quadratic primes </h2>
        <div class="white">
            <p>
                Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
                $$ n^2 + n + 41 $$

            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values
                \( 0 \le n \le 39 \)  However, when \(n = 40, 4- ^2 + 40 = 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 \)is divisible by 41,
                and certainly when \(n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41\) is clearly divisible by 41.

            </p>
            <p>
                The incredible formula \(n^2 -79n + 1601\) waas discovered, which produces 80
                primes for the consecutive values \(0 \le n \le 79\). The product of the coefficients,
                -79 and 1601, is -126479.

        <h3>Algorthim:</h3>
        <p class="algo">
            Interesting problems. I solved this many months back, now looking back at my algorthim, it's not terrible
            The maian conditions are definitely there, but execution was sub-par
        </p>
        <p class="algo">
            Anyhow, there are 2 main condition that will heelp us nararow down the search
            <ol class ="algo">
                <li>
                    The quadractic must be a real number at all times. Hence, 
                    $$ n^2 + an + b > 0 $$ 
                    Using quadratic formula, we get 
                    $$ \frac{-a \,\, \pm \sqrt{a^2 - 4b}}{2} $$
                    We see that \(a^2 - 4b\) must be positive. However, this doesn't realaly tell us much....
                    <p>
                        Another approach is to consider that n = 1 is  solution. Then, a + b + 1 > 0. Hence, we can set a limit to a, given that b is a prime. We could have done 1 or 2 or 3 as the max number of solutions... Well, I think we could have. But I chose this limit
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li> Lastly, a must be odd. We know n can be odd or even. Hence, the quadratic must choose an \(a\) that makes the quadractic odd since primes are odd (except 2). So, if n is even, then \(n^2\) is also even, but b is odd. So, we need \(an\) to be even. Hence, a can be odd or even. Consider whne n is odd. Then \(n^2\) is odd, and b is odd. So, \(an\) must be odd. Since n is odd, a must be odd. If it was even, \(an\) would be even.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="algo">
            Using thesee two restrictions, we can find the a, b that yields the answer
        </p>
        <p class="algo">
            I shouldn't have used Fermat() function again as it takes a lot longer than just simply generating primes using Sieve and checking if each prime is in this array of primes generated by Sieve.
